# RAG Techniques Handbook

A hands-on guide to **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** techniques with practical, straightforward implementations.

## 🎯 About This Repository

This repository takes a clear, hands-on approach to Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), breaking down advanced techniques into straightforward, understandable implementations. Whether you're new to RAG or looking to explore sophisticated retrieval strategies, you'll find practical examples that demystify complex concepts.

## 🧠 What is RAG?

Retrieval-Augmented Generation combines the power of large language models with external knowledge retrieval. Instead of relying solely on what an LLM learned during training, RAG systems fetch relevant information from document stores, databases, or knowledge bases to provide more accurate, up-to-date, and contextually relevant responses.

## 📚 What You'll Learn

- **Basic RAG Pipeline**: Understanding embeddings, vector stores, and simple retrieval
- **Advanced Chunking Strategies**: Smart text splitting for better context preservation
- **Hybrid Search Methods**: Combining semantic and keyword-based retrieval
- **Query Optimization**: Techniques for improving retrieval accuracy
- **Reranking Approaches**: Refining retrieved results for better relevance
- **Multi-Document RAG**: Handling complex queries across multiple sources
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Measuring RAG system performance

## 🛠️ Techniques Covered

Each technique includes:
- Clear explanation of the concept
- Working code implementation
- Practical use cases
- Performance considerations
